**Cornell Electric Vehicles - Chassis Team Knowledgebase**

## 📋 Overview

Hello! Welcome to the **Cornell Electric Vehicles** *Chassis* subteam knowledge base. This serves as a centralized system for our team to build a connected mind-map of technical know-how that can be easily accessed.

This database uses [**Obsidian**](https://obsidian.md), an incredibly useful notes editor that makes organizing data extremely easy. You can read more on getting started with Obsidian below:
