## Understand How Carbon Fiber Interacts with Resin

- Carbon fiber is a ceramic and resin is a polymer
    - Carbon fiber is brittle, but very strong
    - Resin is less strong, but has more flexibility
- The strength of a carbon fiber composite depends greatly on fiber-matrix adhesion
    - CF is inert, so surface needs some treatment to allow resin to bond
    - Good adhesion means the resin can transfer stress to the stiff fibers --> high strength and stiffness
    - Poor adhesion means fibers can "pull out" under load --> lower strength, more brittle fracture
- Types of Treatment
    - Plasma treatment - exposing CF fabric to a low-temperature environment
    - Chemical etching - submerging CF fabric in a chemical solution (acid or oxidizing agent)
    - **most commercially available carbon fiber is pretreated

## Describe the Structure of the Matrix

- as shown below, carbon fiber forms a structure of fibers that lie within the resin matrix

## Describe the Properties of the Material in Various Directions and Applications

- 0º layers: Provide axial strength and stiffness that is ideal for beams and columns that must resist axial loads.
- +/- 45º layers: Provide shear and torsional strength and stiffness that is ideal for torsion shafts and shear webs such as I-beam webs.
- 90º layers: Provide transverse strength and stiffness that is ideal for creating a consolidating layer that keeps everything together and provides strength in pressure vessels.
- Woven carbon exhibits quasi-isotropic properties
    - Consistent mechanical properties in multiple directions
    - Properties can vary slightly depending on the orientation of the fibers
- Young's Modulus in isostrain vs isostress for composite materials:

- Since you have alternating weaves/direction in CF fiber, there isn't necessarily an 'isostrain' or 'isostress,' so the Young's Modulus will be somewhere in the middle. Young's modulus depends on the volume fraction of each component in the composite.

## Understand How Different Resins/Weaves Impact Properties

- Resin selection heavily impacts adhesion
    - Need chemical compatibility (need to research what exactly this entails)
        - Epoxy resin have good adhesion properties and can form strong cross-linked networks
        - Polyester and vinyl ester resins are options, but require additional surface treatments to achieve comparable adhesion to epoxy resins  
            *cheaper, higher shrinkage (can help w mold release), generally considered worse than other epoxy
- Types of weave
    - Plain weave - each fiber alternates over and under one fiber at a time
        - Stable, holds shape, resists unraveling, smooth surface
        - Flat panels, sheets, cosmetic parts
    - Twill weave - fibers go over 2, under 2 (or more), giving a diagonal pattern
        - More pliable, drapes over complex curves better, attractive “twill” look
    - Satin weave - fibers go over several and under one
        - Smoother finish
        - Conforms to complex shapes
        - Used for aerospace, boat hulls, applications needing complex contours
- Basket weave
    - Looser, more flexible, can cover large areas quickly
    - Unidirectional weave
    - Maximum strength along one axis, very stiff
    - Almost no strength perpendicular to fiber direction
## Unperforated Release Film:

- Release film serves to isolate the part from the breather and to control the amount of resin bleed. It has small perforations in a known pattern that allow both trapped air and excess resin to squeeze out of the laminate.
- For Prepreg: You can either cure without bleeding off resin using non-perforated release film, or allow some of the resin to bleed off and also make it easier for air and volatile materials to escape the part.
- Unperforated release film is used to control the resin content of the laminate
- Perforations  
    - P31: 0.6 mm holes in a rectangular spacing 7mm by 5mm but with an additional hole in the middle of the square  
    - P3: 0.4mm holes in square pattern on 12.7mm centers **most common**  
    - P90: 0.4mm holes in a rectangular spacing 15mm by 30mm  
    - P6: 0.4mm holes in square pattern on 50mm centers

-> Tighter hole spacing (more holes): allows more resin to bleed through --> good when you expect excess resin and want a lighter laminate **maximum gas venting or resin bleed**  
-> Wider hole spacing (fewer holes): Restricts resin bleed --> good when you want to maintain resin content (important for mechanical properties) **want to keep resin inside the part and limit bleed**

**without unperforated release film, I think the breather fabric would stick to the part

## Debulking

**What is it?** involves the process of removing air and moisture from the composite laminate before the resin is applied. This compacts the resin, which induces fiber nesting and increases the volume fraction of the sample.  
--> Necessary if using prepregs, not essential if using dry fabric because air doesn't really get trapped between plies like with prepreg

Can help with...

- very thick laminates: light vacuum compaction before infusion can reduce bulk thickness so that the resin flow path isn't too long
- complex shapes: pre-compacting can help fibers conform better and reduce bridging
- stack stability: light vacuum can keep dry plies from shifting before infusion starts
- The driving force in VI is limited to the pressure the equipment is capable of -- vacuum pressure by itself cannot squeeze out as much excess resin, compared to an autoclave or high-pressure RTM cure
- Limits the achievable fiber volume -- lower pressures involved in VI usually result in higher void content (air bubbles trapped in the part after curing and hinder optimum mechanical performance)
- Using LCM results in a less homogenous distributions pf voids (than prepreg) which may cause ACP models to be less accurate
- thickness gradient caused by uneven pressure
- Comparison of the local volume fraction distribution showed that the level of debulking seemed to increase the spatial density of carbon fibers in individual tows after just the low debulking steps were performed

Cons to debulking:

- causes an increase in the fiber volume content, and thus slower filling velocities (harder to process)

Can be useful for dry fabrics if...

- you notice loft (thickness), wrinkling, bridging, or plies that aren't behaving
- fabric stands off large areas or layers shift easily
