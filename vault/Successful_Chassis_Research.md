## ITS Sapuangin won the Urban Concept Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) category at the Shell Eco-marathon three years in a row.

### The one number that matters most is the drag area (Cd​A), which combines the car's shape (Cd​) and its size (A) into a single value.
- The Sapuangin XI Evo 4.0 has a Cd​ of 0.14 and a frontal area of 0.88 m², which gives it an impressive drag area of 0.123 m².
- Here are some of their notable features and strategies:
- Underbody Aerodynamics (The Venturi Effect): This is one of their coolest innovations. The team's design is inspired by the Venturi effect to reduce rolling resistance. By intentionally having a low ground clearance, the car creates a low-pressure area under its body. This pressure difference generates a downforce of -7.24 N, which helps the car stick to the road and reduces the energy lost to rolling resistance.
- The team relies heavily on data. They use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate air resistance and visualize airflow before they even build the car. This helps them identify turbulent areas and refine their design. In a previous car, they used CFD to optimize the placement and height of vortex generators, which resulted in a drag reduction of over 5%.
- Double-Layer Carbon Fiber Body: The Sapuangin XI Evo 4.0 uses a double-layer carbon fiber material for its body, which helps to reduce aerodynamic drag and contributes to a total vehicle weight of just 109 kg, with the body weighing only 14.8 kg. The body also serves as driver protection and helps improve fuel efficiency.
- Innovative Use of Materials: The team even looked for creative ways to reduce weight in unexpected places. They introduced a composite steering wheel made from carbon fiber with a balsa core from repurposed wooden shipping boxes, which helped them win a Vehicle Design award.

## Green Team Mecc competes in the Europe and Africa Shell Eco Marathon Urban Concept division, and had an efficiency of 142.9 Mi/kWh in 2024. 

-  No formal data on drag coefficients or other key metrics posted, however their car has a very similar teardrop shape to our UC'25. 
-  The team apparently uses a "Tank-to-Wheel" multiphysics model to analyse the vehicle's energy consumption. They take into account drag, rolling resistance, and gravitational forces to get a complete picture of all energy leakages. They also use CFD to test airflow on their aero.
-  They are from Politecnico di Milano which has a renowned fluid dynamics lab
-  Their design features enclosed wheel wells - advantageous for a few reasons

- Wheels create turbulent wakes as they spin
- Enclosing smooths airflow, reduces vortex shedding and helps maintain laminar flow along the body sides 
- Even enclosing to the axle line might help massively, because this way the most turbulent region is shielded (top of wheel moves twice as fast as car)
