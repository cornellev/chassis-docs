The topics documented here are based off of Dr. Rajesh Bhaskaran's Canvas Course, titled "**Fluid Dynamics Simulations Using ANSYS**". You can find the course link [here](https://canvas.cornell.edu/courses/58256), or reach out to him directly for access. His **edX** course also has similar material, but might be a little less detailed.
