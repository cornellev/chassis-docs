### Research about Refining Our Process

**Sanding:**

- Sand 220 - 320 - 400 (dry), then 600, 800, 1000 (wet)
- Dry sanding is faster and more effective, however it scratches the surface more and releases fumes. This would need to be done in masks. Because we would switch to wet sanding after the 400, it shouldn't affect surface quality.
- Stop at 1000, instead of 2000 (800 is even possible but we should start at 1000). Doing so would save time and we could make up for release and quality losses with other chemical solutions.

**Polishing/release**

- Doing extra polishing should allow us to improve quality without needing to go to 2000 grit sanding and still achieve a good release. The ideal process I've researched involves 4 steps which are:

1. Wool buffing with heavy cut compound - this will remove scratches and micro-waviness
2. Foam buffing with polishing compound - will get super glossy finish
3. Apply 5 coats of 700-NC for easy release removal.

Optional instead of step 3:  
5. Apply wax with foam pads and buff with microfiber gloss - acts as release agent and will improve quality when releasing  
6. Lightly mist 2 coats of PVA, another release agent that works really well with the wax.  
*I recommend sticking with the original step as it maintains better quality than these 2 options though for more complex geometry pieces this may make removal easier.

**The Proposed Plan**

1. Sand 320 - 400 - 600 - 800 - 1000 all pneumatic with dry guide coat.
2. Buff with heavy cut compound.
3. Polish with current polisher.
4. Apply current release.
5. Layup with carbon fiber debunking every 2 layers.
6. Do vacuum infusion as normal.
7. Sand and apply clear coat resin until surface is perfect.
8. Polish with current polisher.
