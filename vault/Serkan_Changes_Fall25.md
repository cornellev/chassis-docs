## ITS Sapuangin won the Urban Concept Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) category at the Shell Eco-marathon three years in a row.

### The one number that matters most is the drag area (Cd​A), which combines the car's shape (Cd​) and its size (A) into a single value.
- The Sapuangin XI Evo 4.0 has a Cd​ of 0.14 and a frontal area of 0.88 m², which gives it an impressive drag area of 0.123 m².
- Here are some of their notable features and strategies:
- Underbody Aerodynamics (The Venturi Effect): This is one of their coolest innovations. The team's design is inspired by the Venturi effect to reduce rolling resistance. By intentionally having a low ground clearance, the car creates a low-pressure area under its body. This pressure difference generates a downforce of -7.24 N, which helps the car stick to the road and reduces the energy lost to rolling resistance.
- The team relies heavily on data. They use Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations to evaluate air resistance and visualize airflow before they even build the car. This helps them identify turbulent areas and refine their design. In a previous car, they used CFD to optimize the placement and height of vortex generators, which resulted in a drag reduction of over 5%.
- Double-Layer Carbon Fiber Body: The Sapuangin XI Evo 4.0 uses a double-layer carbon fiber material for its body, which helps to reduce aerodynamic drag and contributes to a total vehicle weight of just 109 kg, with the body weighing only 14.8 kg. The body also serves as driver protection and helps improve fuel efficiency.
- Innovative Use of Materials: The team even looked for creative ways to reduce weight in unexpected places. They introduced a composite steering wheel made from carbon fiber with a balsa core from repurposed wooden shipping boxes, which helped them win a Vehicle Design award.

## Green Team Mecc competes in the Europe and Africa Shell Eco Marathon Urban Concept division, and had an efficiency of 142.9 Mi/kWh in 2024. 

-  No formal data on drag coefficients or other key metrics posted, however their car has a very similar teardrop shape to our UC'25. 
-  The team apparently uses a "Tank-to-Wheel" multiphysics model to analyse the vehicle's energy consumption. They take into account drag, rolling resistance, and gravitational forces to get a complete picture of all energy leakages. They also use CFD to test airflow on their aero.
-  They are from Politecnico di Milano which has a renowned fluid dynamics lab
-  Their design features enclosed wheel wells - advantageous for a few reasons

- Wheels create turbulent wakes as they spin
- Enclosing smooths airflow, reduces vortex shedding and helps maintain laminar flow along the body sides 
- Even enclosing to the axle line might help massively, because this way the most turbulent region is shielded (top of wheel moves twice as fast as car)


# Forged Carbon mold design research

# 3D Printed Molds 

## Process

- A mold is designed in CAD and produced using a 3D printer (commonly PLA, ABS, or PETG).
- The mold surface is post-processed (sanded, sealed, and coated with release agents or epoxy surfacing coat) to prevent resin leaks and improve finish.
- Chopped carbon tow is combined with resin, pressed into the mold, and cured either at room temperature or in an oven.


## Benefits

- Low cost: Inexpensive compared to CNC machining or cast resin molds.
- Fast turnaround: Ideal for prototyping and one-off parts, since molds can be printed quickly.
- Complex geometry: 3D printing enables intricate designs and organic shapes without expensive tooling.

## Drawbacks

- Surface quality: Print layer lines and porosity require sealing and finishing
- Thermal resistance: Thermoplastics can deform under heat and pressure during curing.
- Durability: Limited lifespan; molds wear down quickly with repeated use.


# Epoxy Resin Cast Molds

## Process

- A positive master model is created (via CNC machining or 3D printing).
- The master is coated in a release agent, and epoxy tooling resin is poured over it to form a negative mold.
- Once cured, the resin mold is sanded and polished, then used for layup of chopped carbon tow and resin.

## Benefits

- Improved durability: Stronger than 3D printed molds, capable of moderate thermal cycles.
- Better surface finish: Epoxy resins produce smoother mold surfaces, leading to higher-quality part finishes.
- Repeatability: Suitable for small batch production (multiple identical parts).

## Drawbacks

- Time-consuming: Requires creation of a master, casting, and curing before use.
- Higher cost: Epoxy tooling materials are more expensive than basic 3D prints.
- Limited lifespan: Still less durable than metal molds, especially under high pressure/temperature cycles


# CNC-Machined Aluminum or Steel Molds

## Process

- The mold is designed in CAD and CNC-machined directly into aluminum or steel.
- Precision machining allows for highly accurate surfaces and fine details.
- The mold can be heated during curing and withstand compression molding pressures, ensuring a high-quality final product.

## Benefits

- High durability: Can withstand repeated thermal cycles and high pressures.
- Excellent finish: Produces professional-grade surfaces with minimal post-processing.
- Structural reliability: Best option for producing functional, load-bearing carbon fiber parts.
- Long-term investment: Useful if the team plans to make multiple iterations or larger quantities.

## Drawbacks

- Cost: Significantly more expensive in terms of material and machining time.
- Lead time: CNC programming and machining can take longer than 3D printing.
- Overkill for one-off parts: If parts are not repeated, the investment may not be justified.
