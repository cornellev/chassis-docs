Wet Layup with Vacuum Bagging
This process is done by hand, and involves manually applying resin to dry carbon fiber inside a mold. 

Firstly, we must prepare the mold with a releasing agent. This prevents the finished part from sticking. Then, we cut sheets of dry carbon fiber to the appropriate size and shape for the mold. Next, apply a thin layer of resin to the mold. A layer of dry carbon fiber is placed on top and "wetted out" with more resin using a brush. We should repeat this method for every layer of carbon. 

Next we must take precautions to ensure that the carbon fiber will set properly. These steps result in a part which is more consistent and has a better fiber-to-resin ratio. Vacuum bagging uses pressure to compact each layer together, remove air bubbles and squeeze out excess resin. Here are the steps: Firstly, apply one layer of peel ply to the wet surface of the carbon. Peel ply is a synthetic fabric, often with release agent, that allows resin to pass through it while also preventing the bag from sticking to the part. Next, (Optional), we can place a perforated release film on top of the peel ply. this film is used to control the flow of resin out of the part. Next, we should place a layer of breather/bleeder cloth. This cloth has two main functions: It allows air to be evenly distributed along the length and width of the part, ensuring consistent vacuum force. Secondly. it absorbs excess resin which comes out of the release film, thereby reducing the chance of the resin sticking to the stack. 

(This step should be completed before even preparing the mold). Cut pieces of plastic to the required dimensions. The plastic should have more than enough surface area to form a complete bubble around the mold. Use tacky tape to join strips of plastic together, and ensure complete air tightness. Once the bag is ready to use, place it around the mold and seal it using more tacky tape. Cut a small hole in the vacuum bag and install the vacuum port connector. We need to place a small piece of cloth directly over the port on the inside to prevent the bag from sealing shut. Finally, allow the resin to cure under the pressure for the time specified by the manufacturer. 



Prepreg Layup with Oven Cure
This layup method may be useful for the manufacture of parts which will undergo high load. The prepreg process leads to a very high fibre/resin ratio, which is advantageous for several reasons. Firstly, since carbon is significantly lighter than resin, and the ratio of carbon is high, the part will be significantly lighter overall. Secondly, the mechanical properties of the part are improved. In a carbon fibre composite, the fibres provide nearly all the stiffness and strength. The resin mainly binds them together and transfers load between them. More fibres = the part can carry the same load at a lower weight.
