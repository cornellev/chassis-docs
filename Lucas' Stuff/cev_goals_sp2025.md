# CEV - Goals SP25

##### Target \#1

1 - What is one facet of metacognitive learning that I want to focus on developing/strengthening this semester?

One thing that I want to focus on this semester is elevating my team members interests. I want to be sensitive to the ways in which my subteam members are learning and how they are taking in information and new concepts.

2 - What is one individual goal related to my metacognitive learning this semester?

One goal related to this is to have the goal by the end of the semester for freshmen to be able to present what they've learned informally, so that I can practice being a good leader and moderator, and help my team members grow.

3 - How does my metacognitive learning target relate to my role and work on my team/sub-team?

This relates because this informs the work that I will be doing - if I am able to identify strengths, weaknesses, and tendencies in group members early (before things get critical), then I can save a lot of time in the future.

4 - What does success look like for this learning target?

In my opinion, success for this target looks like having a clear way of showing that I've been able to motivate my subteam members to pursue things that they are interested in, in a concrete way.

##### Target \#2 

1 - What are the main goals of my team/sub-team this semester?

The main goal of my sub-team this semester is to get a carbon fiber shell manufactured before competition.

2 - What technical domain am I working in this semester?

Nothing really technical, more in carbon fiber manufacturing and making sure that everything goes smoothly. The one thing that I want to focus on this semester that is technical is becoming more proficient in manual machining in the shop.

3 - What is one individual goalÂ related to my technical domain this semester?

One goal related to my domain this semester is to get Green Apron.

4 - What does success look like for this learning target?

For me, success looks like getting the chassis manufactured and getting Green Apron for myself.

##### Target \#3

1 - What career readiness competency do I want to focus on developing/strengthening this semester?

I want to focus on clear communication this semester.

2 - How will I develop/strengthen my chosen career readiness competency this semester?

I will strengthen this by making an active effort to make expectations clear and nothing ambiguous with my team or with anyone who interacts with what I work with.

3 - What does success look like for this learning target?

Pretty much what I said above.
