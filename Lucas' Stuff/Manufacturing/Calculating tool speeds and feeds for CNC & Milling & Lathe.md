- For each tool that a manufacturer makes, there will be an included SFM for the tool and material that you are running it with.
- Based on the SFM provided, you can then calculate the **speed** and the **feed** for the specific tool material combination that you plan on cutting.
- To calculate your RPM (i.e. cutting **speed** *n*), the formula is:
$$n=\frac{v_{c} \times 12}{D \times \pi}$$
* Where $D$ is the tool diameter, and $v_c$ is the cutting speed (in SFM, Surface Feet / minute).
* In the tool catalog, each material will be coded as:

**Look at Tool Catalog!** (i.e. Kennametal will have their own tooling catalog with SFM included)
