# UC25 Mold Splits

**Design Considerations**
- <u>Back of car</u>: The rear of the bubble needs to be easily liftable such that the luggage compartment is easily accessible
	- <font color="orange"><i>Space must be available for a rectangular rigid luggage with dimensions of 500 x 400 x 200 mm (L X H X W).</i></font>
- <u>Doors</u>
	- <font color="orange"><i>Each door must have a minimum dimension of 500 x 800 mm. This will be verified with a rectangular template of 500 x 800 mm with 500 mm radius corners vertical or horizontal.</i></font>
- <u>Bulkhead & Driver Compartment</u>
	- <font color="orange"><i>The Driver's compartment must have a minimum height of 880 mm and a minimum width of 700 mm at the Driver's shoulders.</i></font>
	- Another consideration: <font color="red">Teams must submit technical drawings, photographs or animations of their entire vehicle design to the organizers for approval at their earliest opportunity.</font>
