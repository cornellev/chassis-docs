# UC25 Mirrors

**Framework for design and testing**

- Look at examples of mirror designs on ultra efficient vehicles and take note of their design considerations
- Ensure adequate visibility from driver cockpit
- Maybe find a way to have automatic folding of the mirrors while not using a lot of energy?
