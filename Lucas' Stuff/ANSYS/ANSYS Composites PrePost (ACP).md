*Remaining Questions*:
- What are Tsai-Wu Constants?
- Why are the Polar Properties of a Sub Laminate and Stackup important? What do they mean?

<b><u>Setup for ACP Pre</u></b>
**Engineering Data**:
- Orthotropic Elasticity
- Orthotropic Stress Limits
- [[Tsai-Wu Constants]]
- Ply Type

For example, for a unidirectional weave that is 700 MPa in compression, the setup in Engineering Data would look like this:

And something similar can be done for a core.

When first opening the setup dialog for the Pre-component of ACP, the first step is to define the fabrics used in the layup. This is analogous to us defining the materials in the Engineering Data section, however the only difference here is that we are telling ANSYS the **thickness** that we want our weave to be represented as.
